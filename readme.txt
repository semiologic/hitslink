== Description ==

[HitsLink](http://go.semiologic.com/hitslink) is a paid-for stats service that is a good enough to be seen as an alternative to Google Analytics. (There is a 30-day risk-free trial period.)

To configure HitsLink, browse Settings / Hitslink and enter the tracking script that you'll find after signing up.

The plugin is set up to ignore authors that are logged in, and to track special events such as newsletter subscriptions.

== FAQ ==

= Why Should I Use A Paid-For Service? =

A frequent question that comes up is why should anyone use a paid-for service when Google Analytics is free. It's a good question, and there are two main reasons.

Firstly, it's never bad to have several sources of stats. Stats are tracked differently from one service to the next, and thus turn up different results. As Mark Twain famously put it when describing the persuasive power of numbers, there are three kinds of lies: lies, damned lies, and statistics. Deceiving oneself with statistical data is easy. Doing so with a single source of figures is easier still.

More importantly to black hatters, you don't necessarily want Google to know your site's real stats in the first place. To put things mildly, you'll want to keep Google at a healthy distance when you measure how well your dirty SEO tricks and otherwise shady traffic generation techniques are working.

It could be argued that Google knows your stats anyway if you're delivering AdSense ads on your site. But this is only partially true â€” recall that Google Analytics sign-ups were shut down for a few months after its initial launch, because of the extreme load on its infrastructure.
